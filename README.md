# BrowZer
A projector-mirror augmenter reality viewer.

The JupyterLab book will display broken if you preview it in GitHub, since the embedded links to graphics do not work.  You will need to download it to view on your own machine.

This project is shelved.  The horizontal rotation is effective only at the vertical midline.  As you go further up or down the ratio of projector radius to mirror radius diverges from the 1:2 ratio needed for rotational symmetry.

It is possible to scrap the rotational symmetry and then use an incremental construction in both vertical and horizontal steps.  It is not clear how large a field of view could be obtained.  I might revisit it someday.
